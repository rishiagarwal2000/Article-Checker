#  Article Checker

This code checks use of articles.  
It also handles context sensitive cases.  
e.g. 'This is a watch I want.' is changed to 'This is the watch I want.'  

article_checker.py contains a function art_check which takes a sentence as input and gives the corrected sentence as output.
There is pickle file - vowels.pickle which contains list of words beginning with vowels but preceded with 'a' and not 'an'.  

Hope you like the code.
